## Precedence

The priority order is:

1. Command line flags (highest priority)
1. Environment variables
1. Configuration file
1. Default settings (lowest priority)

The intent is to support a *feathered* layering of configuration settings; if,
for example, a configuration file provides nearly all settings that you want,
specify just the settings that you wish to override via command-line flags (or
environment variables) and use the configuration file for the other settings.

## Command-line Arguments

- Flags marked as **`required`** must be set via CLI flag *or* within a
  TOML-formatted configuration file.
- Flags *not* marked as required are for settings where a useful default is
  already defined.

This is an attempt to work around race conditions between EZproxy updating its state file (which has been observed to have a delay of up to several seconds) and this application *reading* the active file.

If false, session termination will not be initiated by this application, though current session IDs found as part of preparing for termination will still be logged for troubleshooting purposes. If setting (or leaving) this as false, the assumption is that either no handling of reported users is desired (other than perhaps logging and notification) or that a tool such as fail2ban is used to monitor the reported users log file and temporarily block the source IP in order to force session timeout. |

The
[`contrib/brick/config.example.toml`](../contrib/brick/config.example.toml)
file is provided as a starting point for your own `config.toml` configuration
file. The default values provided by this configuration file should lineup
with the default application values if not specified.

Once reviewed and potentially adjusted, your copy of the `config.toml` file
can be placed in a location of your choosing and referenced using the
`--config-file` flag. See the [Command-line
arguments](#command-line-arguments) sections for usage details.

## Worth noting

- Notifications are disabled unless required values are provided

  | Notification Type | Required Value                          |

  | Microsoft Teams   | webhook URL                             |
  | Email             | remote SMTP server (FQDN or IP Address) |
  | Email             | sender address                          |
  | Email             | recipient address(es)                   |

- For best results, limit your choice of TCP port to an unprivileged user
  port between `1024` and `49151`

- Log format names map directly to the Handlers provided by the `apex/log`
  package. Their descriptions are copied from the [official
  README](https://github.com/apex/log/blob/master/Readme.md) and provided
  below for reference:

  | Log Format ("Handler") | Description                        |
  | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | `cli`                  | human-friendly CLI output          |
  | `json`                 | provides log output in JSON format |
  | `logfmt`               | plain-text logfmt output           |
  | `text`                 | human-friendly colored output      |
  | `discard`              | discards all logs                  |

- Microsoft Teams webhook URLs
  - have one of two known FQDNs; both are valid as of this writing
     1. `outlook.office.com`
        - new webhook URLs use this one
     1. `outlook.office365.com`
        - older webhook URLs use this one
        - still referenced in official documentation
  - Example URL: <https://outlook.office.com/webhook/a1269812-6d10-44b1-abc5-b84f93580ba0@9e7b80c7-d1eb-4b52-8582-76f921e416d9/IncomingWebhook/3fdd6767bae44ac58e5995547d66a4e4/f332c8d9-3397-4ac5-957b-b8e3fc465a8c>
